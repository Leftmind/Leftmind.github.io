# Disgusting react app

Just make this abomination work on mobile and web

## About the app
routes are
-login
-signup
-homepage

The homepage handles absolutely everything based on a state that decides what to render (genius move). Every firebase command is written directly in the view (or in any subcomponents related to the main view)


## TODO


### Pengakollen
Vidar working on it

### Mina mål / "Utmaning"
the same as the the previous version, there is updated points for this

should be easy enought with react cards. Every card should give X amount of points to the company aswell. Does absolutely not need to look the same

### Profile/company page
Make the profile photo work.

### Cosmetics

* Make a banner on all the pages. This should be all the cosmetics we need to make it look decent.

(^ like that one in the previous version)

* Possibly create more cosmetics that make the overall app look better
